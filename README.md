* **Blog Post:** Coming Soon
* **Motivation:** I recently ran into a challenge when trying to cleanly create rows in an HTML table inside a React component.
* **Primary Takeaway:**
  * 4.9.1 The table element
    * Categories:
      * Flow content.
      * Palpable content.
    * Contexts in which this element can be used:
      * Where flow content is expected.
    * Content model:
      * In this order: optionally a caption element, followed by zero or more colgroup elements, followed optionally by a thead element, **followed by either zero or more tbody elements** or one or more tr elements, followed optionally by a tfoot element, optionally intermixed with one or more script-supporting elements. - https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/tables.html#the-table-element
